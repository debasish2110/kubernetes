# Deployment Strategies: Recreate, Rolling, Blue-Green, and Canary

This document explains four widely used deployment strategies in DevOps and cloud-native environments. Understanding their differences is crucial for selecting the right approach based on system requirements, risk tolerance, and user impact.

---

## 📦 1. Recreate Deployment

### ✅ Description:

In a **Recreate** deployment, the existing version of the application is **completely shut down** before the new version is started.

### 🛠️ Process:

1. Stop and terminate the current application version.
2. Start deploying the new version.
3. Route traffic once the new version is fully available.

### ✔️ Pros:

* Simple to implement and manage.
* Ensures no version conflicts.

### ❌ Cons:

* **Downtime is inevitable.**
* Not suitable for systems requiring high availability.

### 📌 When to Use:

* Small-scale applications or internal tools.
* Low traffic and non-critical systems.
* Environments where downtime is acceptable.

## 🔁 2. Rolling Deployment

### ✅ Description:

A **Rolling** deployment replaces instances of the previous version with the new version **incrementally**, usually in batches.

### 🛠️ Process:

1. Replace a few old version pods/instances with the new version.
2. Monitor for errors.
3. Continue rolling updates until all old instances are replaced.

### ✔️ Pros:

* Minimal to no downtime.
* Easier to roll back than recreate.

### ❌ Cons:

* May have a temporary mix of old and new versions.
* Slightly more complex to monitor.

### 📌 When to Use:

* Medium to large-scale applications.
* Services that can tolerate brief versions coexisting.
* Environments requiring high availability with moderate risk.

## 💚 3. Blue-Green Deployment

### ✅ Description:

In **Blue-Green** deployment, two environments (Blue and Green) exist. One is live (say Blue), and the other (Green) is the updated version that will go live after testing.

### 🛠️ Process:

1. Deploy new version to the inactive environment.
2. Test the new version.
3. Switch traffic from old to new environment.

### ✔️ Pros:

* Zero downtime.
* Easy and instant rollback.

### ❌ Cons:

* Requires double the infrastructure (for Blue and Green environments).
* Higher operational costs.

### 📌 When to Use:

* Mission-critical applications requiring zero downtime.
* Systems with robust infrastructure budget.
* Scenarios where full pre-release testing is vital.

---

## 🐤 4. Canary Deployment

### ✅ Description:

A **Canary** deployment gradually rolls out the new version to a small subset of users before a full rollout.

### 🛠️ Process:

1. Deploy the new version to a small percentage of users (e.g., 5%).
2. Monitor metrics and logs.
3. Increase rollout percentage if no issues are found.

### ✔️ Pros:

* Fine-grained control over deployment.
* Real user testing before full rollout.
* Quick rollback if issues arise.

### ❌ Cons:

* More complex setup and monitoring.
* Requires automated observability and alerting systems.

### 📌 When to Use:

* Large-scale consumer-facing apps.
* Scenarios where incremental rollout minimizes risk.
* Environments with strong observability and feedback loops.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Strategy   | Downtime | Rollback | Infrastructure Cost | Risk Level | Complexity | Best For                        |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Recreate   | High     | Easy     | Low                 | High       | Low        | Small, non-critical apps        |
| Rolling    | Low      | Medium   | Medium              | Medium     | Medium     | Production apps with HA         |
| Blue-Green | None     | Easy     | High                | Low        | Medium     | Critical apps with testing need |
| Canary     | None     | Easy     | Medium              | Low        | High       | Gradual, safe rollouts          |

Choose your deployment strategy based on application criticality, availability requirements, infrastructure capabilities, and acceptable risk levels.
